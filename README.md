<h1>AirBnB_clone</h1>

This is a team project made for Holberton School. It consists in building a clone of AirBnB. This is the first part.

This program contains all the classes needed to store data, which is handled by the class FileStorage.

<h2>Installation</h2>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahinmeric/AirBnB_clone
```
Then, switch to the `AirBnB clone` directory and run:
```bash
./console.py
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

Execute the `console.py`, and the prompt line will appear. Then, you can type an input.

~~~~
root@.. ..AirBnB\_clone#./console
root@.. ..AirBnB\_clone#$ show user 38f22813-2753-4d42-b37c-57a17f1e4f88

output: if user exists, prints the string representation
~~~~

The program also works in non-interactive mode, passing a command while using echo.

~~~~
root@.. ..AirBnB\_clone# echo "help" | ./console
~~~~

<h2>Testing</h2>

All the tests are defined in the `tests.py` subdirectory.
